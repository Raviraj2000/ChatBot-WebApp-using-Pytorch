# ChatBot-WebApp-using-Pytorch
This is a simple Chatbot made using Natural Language Processing, pytorch deep learning library and frontend library Streamlit.

This chatbot is reprogramable. All you have to do is add tags and responses in intents.json file and retrain the model.

The GUI for this chatbot webapp is experimental and very simple as Streamlit library is fairly new and does not not have support for many necessary features.
Streamlit runs the entire script everytime you interact with any widget hence the model can't maintain the chat history and refreshes responses everytime.

**I will update the model as new features are released in Streamlit.**

## To run this project:
>- Install streamlit [pip install streamlit]
>- Enter streamlit run chat.py in command prompt
